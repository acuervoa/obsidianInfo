[Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)

Before you start installing extensions left and right, it's good to know of the existence of Settings Sync. It allows you to sync pretty much everything you customize on VSCode to Github, from settings to keyboard shortcuts to other VSCode extensions.

[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Live Server launches a local development server with a live reload feature both for static and dynamic pages.

Every time you save your code, you'll instantly see the changes reflected in the browser. You'll be much faster at spotting errors and it's much easier to do some quick experiments with your code.

[Bracket Pair colorized](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)

The clue's in the title, but Bracket Pair Colorizer gives the opening and closing brackets matching colors, making it much easier to know which brackets belong together.

[CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)

This extension is invaluable for front-end developers. Inspired by a similar feature in the IDE Brackets, CSS Peek allows you to extend your HTML and ejs file to show CSS/SCSS/LESS code within the source code.

It also allows you to quickly jump to the right CSS code if you know the class or ID name.

[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

Although it isn't life-threateningly important, I prefer my code to have no spelling errors. Code Spell Checker underlines words that it doesn't recognize in its dictionary files.

The extension is available in many different languages and supports jargon such as medical terms.

[Icon Fonts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idleberg.icon-fonts)

Icon Fonts offers snippets for a variety of icon fonts, including the popular Font Awesome v5 icon pack.

[TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)

I confess. I've been guilty of writing TODOs in my comments to then totally forget about them. TODO Highlight makes them stand out much more.

You can toggle the highlights and can also list all the highlighted annotations and reveal them from the corresponding file.

[vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)

 VSCode-icons adds a splash of color and cute little icons to your IDE that

 [Regex previewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrmarti.regex)
 
 Regex Previewer gives you a side document that matches your regex.

 [Git lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
 
 GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities of Visual Studio Code. This is a powerful extension that allows you to see who, why, and how lines of code have changed over time (among lots of other features).

GitLens is a highly customizable extension. If you don’t like a particular setting, you can easily turn it off in settings.

[Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)

Similar to GitLens, Git History is a VSCode extension that gives a visual of the git log. No longer should you look through git log in the terminal.

The extension is quite comprehensive as well. It allows you to compare branches, commits, and files across commits. You can also look up Github avatars, which is quite neat.

[Colorize](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kamikillerto.vscode-colorize)

Sticking with colors, Colorize instantly visualizes CSS colors in your CSS/SASS/Less/... files. This makes it very easy to see at a glance which colors you’re using where.
